				"You create a channel to a region of the Shadow Realm that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging entropy fills a sphere 20 feet in radius, centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents exhaustion.",
