This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are completely paralyzed. An affected creature or construct repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success, though constructs make this saving throw with disadvantage. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in its area of effect."
