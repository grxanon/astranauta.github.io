For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you receive a 3rd-level slot plus a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.
